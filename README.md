# Climate Trace analysis

## Overview
This climate trace analysis is a groundbreaking initiative that leverages cutting-edge technology to provide accurate a database of the greenhouses gases emission for decade(2015 - 2024)
Climate Trace analysis is aimed at tracking and analysing  emissions of greenhouses gases like(CO2) from various sectors of these four countries(Canada, France, Great Britain, United States of America) among the top 10 global countries with higher GDP per year.



## Mission
The mission is to help promote green renewable energy, considering the data facts from http://climate_trace.org on the emissions of green house gases from the afor mentioned countries stated above. 

## Key Features
- **Emission Data**: Climate Trace provides up-to-date emissions data from multiple sectors, including;
1. Agriculture,
2. Energy,
3. Transportation
4. Flourinated_gases
5. Forestry_and_land_use
6. Manufacturing
7. Mineral_extraction
8. Power
9. Waste
10. Buildings

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Climate Trace utilizes satellite technology to gather emissions data from various sources, including power plants, factories, and transportation networks.
2. **Data Processing**: Advanced machine learning algorithms analyze the collected data to estimate emissions accurately.
3. **Data Visualization**: The processed data is presented in an accessible format in a csvfile, allowing users to explore emissions trends and patterns.

### Limitations
Since the data records are century records, so visualizing all data will be quite unclear .








## Plan
- **Awareness: Initiatives to raise awareness about the importance of emissions tracking,  and it adverse effects on the environments including climate and the risks it poses to humans health.

## Conclusion
Climate Trace is  to provide the most accurate emissions data available, fostering a community dedicated to combating climate change through informed decision-making and accountability.
